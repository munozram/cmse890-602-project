### Computing persistent homology on a directed graph
The main function in this project is ```newfiltration_persistence```, which computes persistent homology on a given weighted directed graph and outputs a persistent diagram. All other functions are auxiliary.

For a simple example, go to [Tutorial](tutorial.md).
